## TODO List
1. :ballot_box_with_check: Plot something on plotly
2. :ballot_box_with_check: Add slider capability
3. :ballot_box_with_check: Add multiple graphs to plotly
4. :ballot_box_with_check: Embed plotly graph in website (for more info, see [Plotly embedding help](https://help.plot.ly/embed-graphs-in-websites/))
5. :ballot_box_with_check: Read in output from voronoi.py
6. Make sense of lines, edges, sites, vertices from voronoi.py output
  * How should these be converted to plots?
  * Define piece-wise functions for the edges
7. Plot all edges of a voronoi diagram
8. Add in parts of lines based on sites and slider
  * Only display parabolas if the slider is past their point
  * Shift parabolas with slider
  * Display edges as piecewise functions
  * *NOTE: This is going to be the bulk of the work!*
9. Shade regions as they form
  * Use voronoi demo in plotly
10. Reach Goal: Take in points from user, compute voronoi, and visualize

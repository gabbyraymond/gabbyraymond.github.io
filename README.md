## TODO List
1. :ballot_box_with_check: Plot something on plotly
2. :ballot_box_with_check: Add slider capability
3. :ballot_box_with_check: Add multiple graphs to plotly
4. :ballot_box_with_check: Embed plotly graph in website (for more info, see [Plotly embedding help](https://help.plot.ly/embed-graphs-in-websites/))
5. :ballot_box_with_check: Read in output from voronoi.py
6. :ballot_box_with_check: Plot all edges of a voronoi diagram
7. Write voronoi diagram generator that keeps track of wavefront states during ranges of steps
  * Use this to display edges as piecewise functions
8. Add in parts of lines based on sites and slider
  * Only display parabolas if the slider is past their point
  * Shift parabolas with slider
9. Shade regions as they form
  * Use voronoi demo in plotly
10. Reach Goal: Take in points from user, compute voronoi, and visualize
